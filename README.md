Test Automation Strategy Document

1. Overview
The purpose of this document is to outline the test automation strategy for the Respond.io platform. The platform consists UI components, and this strategy aims to cover automated testing of critical flows: the Login Flow and Add Workspace User Flow.

This strategy includes the following key areas:
* Test Automation Scope
* Framework Design
* Tools & Technologies
* Test Scenarios
* Test Data Management
* Reporting & Metrics
* Repository Structure


2. Test Automation Scope

2.1 Sections to Automate
The key flows to be automated include:
1. Login Flow
o Validating successful login using valid credentials (UI)
o Handling login failure with invalid credentials (UI)
2. Add Workspace User Flow
o Adding a new user to the workspace (UI)
o Validating successful addition and error handling (UI)
2.2. Test Types
* UI Tests: Verify the user interface functionality using browser automation.
* End-to-End Tests: Validate the complete user flows by combining UI tests.

3. Test Automation Framework

3.1 Framework Architecture
The framework is based on the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for UI automation. This pattern enhances maintainability by separating test logic from UI elements.
For API automation, the framework utilizes Playwright’s built-in capabilities to handle HTTP requests and responses, ensuring consistency across both UI layers.

3.2 Key Components
* Page Objects: Encapsulate the UI elements and interactions for each page.
* Test Cases: Contain the actual test logic for validating workflows.
* Helpers: Reusable utility functions for API requests and data handling.
* Configuration: A centralized configuration for browser settings, base URLs, test timeouts, etc.

3.3 Tools and Technologies
* Playwright: Used for both UI test automation.
* Node.js: JavaScript runtime for test script execution.
* Allure Reporting: Provides comprehensive HTML reports for each test run.

3.4 Folder Structure
The following is the project folder structure:

??? tests/                      # Test cases
?   ??? ui/                     # UI test cases
?   ??? api/                    # API test cases
??? data/                       # Test data
??? helpers/                    # Helper methods
??? pageObjects/                # Page Object Models
??? reports/                    # Test reports
??? playwright.config.js        # Playwright configuration
??? README.md                   # Project documentation

4. Test Scenarios

4.1 Login Flow
UI Test Scenarios
1. Login with valid credentials: Verify successful login and redirection to the dashboard.

4.2 Add Workspace User Flow

UI Test Scenarios
1. Add user with valid details: Check that a new user is added successfully and appears in the user list.

5. Test Data Management

5.1 Static Data
Test data, such as valid and invalid credentials and roles, is stored in JSON files located in the data/ directory. This ensures data reusability and separation of concerns between test logic and test data.

5.2 Dynamic Data
Some tests require dynamic data (e.g., user creation). For such cases:
* Data is generated programmatically during test execution.

5.3 Environment Variables
Sensitive data (e.g., API keys, credentials) are managed using environment variables and stored in a .env file.

6. Reporting and Metrics

6.1 Reporting Tools
* Playwright HTML Reports: Automatically generated after each test run and stored in the reports/ folder.
* Allure Reports: A more detailed report generated by integrating allure-playwright. This report includes test case status, screenshots, and logs.

6.2 Metrics
The following metrics will be tracked:
1. Test Execution Time: Time taken to execute all tests.
2. Pass/Fail Rate: Percentage of tests that pass vs. fail.
3. Test Coverage: The number of automated test cases compared to the total number of test cases.
4. Error Rate: The rate at which errors occur in the application during testing (API failures, UI exceptions).

6.3 Notifications
Test results can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins) to trigger test execution automatically and send notifications (via Slack, email) on success/failure.

7. Execution Strategy

7.1 Local Execution
To run tests locally:
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install dependencies:
		npm install
3. Run UI tests:
		npx playwright test tests/ui
4. Run API tests:
		npx playwright test tests/api
5. Generate reports:
		npx playwright show-report

7. Conclusion

This automation strategy is designed to cover essential user flows in the Respond.io platform. By automating both UI components, the goal is to reduce manual testing efforts, improve efficiency, and catch regressions early in the development cycle. The strategy also ensures scalability and maintainability with clear separation of concerns and reusable test components.
